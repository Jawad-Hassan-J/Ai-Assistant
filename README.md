## **AI Assistant Project**

### **Overview**: An AI Assistant where the user can type the feature they need to run, and the app will decide the closest matching function from the available ones.  

### **Technology**: The project is built with Python. The functions are not written entirely from scratch but organized to be reusable and extendable.  

### **Core Idea**: The heart of the project is machine learning â€” understanding both the theory and the technical side, and learning how to perform the functions effectively.  

### **Structure**: Since the project includes multiple features, the work is separated into different files, and each final function is kept in its own place.
